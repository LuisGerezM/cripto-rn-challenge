Our React-native coding challenge is a simple "Crypto Tracker". Users should be able to add new cryptocurrencies, visualize the current price and the change in price in % for the last 24 hours, and also be able to remove a cryptocurrency from the "Crypto Tracker".

```
Important: Please make sure you use ReactNative (not Expo), Redux Thunk, Hooks, and TypeScript.
Check your solution into github with a readme.md file detailing instructions
on how to get the app up and running...
```

# Suggested design and assets:

You can find below a design mockup for the challenge. Please make sure you follow this design as close as possible, as it will be evaluated:

### 1) List of Cryptocurrencies

This screen should have the list of cryptocurrencies that the user has added to their dashboard. Each crypto should have it's value and a metric showing the percentage change. Also, remember to add a scrollview and an empty component. This list should remain even if the user exits the app.

### 2) Connect Data with API

The goal of this is to connect the app's data with the API.

### 3) Add new Cryptocurrency

In this screen, the user can add a new cryptocurrency from a list of all available cryptos. Remember to filter those that are already added.
Please use the following API to get cryptocurrency metrics: https://data.messari.io/api/v1/assets/btc/metrics.

### 4) Update Cryptocurrency Data

The goal is to create an updating cycle so the value of user's cryptos are always updated.

# Evaluation Criteria

- Understanding of core Javascript concepts
- Understanding of ReactNative and Redux frameworks
